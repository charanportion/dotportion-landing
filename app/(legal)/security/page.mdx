# Security Policy

lastUpdated: "09 December 2025"

DotPortion prioritizes security across all systems and features.

## Core Security Practices

- Encrypted secrets (AES-256 or equivalent)
- TLS/HTTPS enforced for all services
- Role-based access control
- Environment-level isolation
- Secure workflow execution

---

## Secrets Management

- Secrets encrypted at rest and in transit
- Not exposed in logs or debug output
- Restricted internal access

---

## Data Isolation

Workspaces are isolated logically to prevent unauthorized access between users.

---

## Incident Response

If a security incident occurs:

1. Systems are isolated
2. Users are notified if impacted
3. Patches and fixes are deployed
4. A root-cause analysis is performed
